# Pulse - Backend
# Smart Consultation for Heart Diseases 

Welcome to the backend repository of our Smart Consultation for Heart Diseases project! This repository contains the backend codebase developed using the Django framework to power the smart consultation platform.



## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to provide an intelligent and efficient consultation system for heart diseases Based  On AI. The backend serves as the backbone of the application, handling data storage, processing, and serving APIs to the frontend.



## Features

- **Django Framework**: The project is built using the Django framework, a powerful and flexible web development framework in Python.

- **RESTful APIs**: We have developed a comprehensive set of RESTful APIs to facilitate communication between the frontend and backend. These APIs enable seamless data retrieval, storage, and manipulation for the consultation platform.

- **Database Management**: The backend interacts with a database to store and retrieve relevant data. We have utilized Django's built-in ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) to handle database operations efficiently.


## Getting Started

To get started with the backend project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**: Begin by cloning this repository to your local machine using the following command:

`git clone https://github.com/PydevAzmi/Pulse.git`

2. **Install Dependencies**: Navigate to the project directory and install the required dependencies by running the following command:
`pip install -r requirements.txt`

3. **Configure the Environment**: Set up the necessary environment variables required for the project. Refer to the `config.example.env` file for the required variables and create a new `.env` file with the appropriate values.

4. **Database Setup**: Configure the database settings in the project's settings file. You can use SQLite for local development or choose a different database system based on your requirements.

5. **Run Migrations**: Apply the database migrations using the following command:

`python manage.py migrate`

6. **Start the Development Server**: Launch the development server by running the following command:

`python manage.py runserver`

7. **API Documentation**: The API documentation can be found at [API Documentation](api-documentation.md). It provides details about the available endpoints, request/response formats, and authentication requirements.
